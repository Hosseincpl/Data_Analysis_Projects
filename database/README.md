## Objective

The objective of this process is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to design a star schema data warehouse and implement data from another database using SQL Server.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this process, you should have the following:

- Access to SQL Server
- Knowledge of SQL queries
- Understanding of star schema data warehouse design principles
- Understanding of the source database structure

## Steps

1. **Design the Star Schema Data Warehouse**
    - Identify the business requirements and determine the fact tables and dimensions that will be needed.
    - Create the fact tables and dimensions using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
    - Define the relationships between the fact tables and dimensions.
    - Populate the tables with the necessary data.
2. **Analyze the Source Database**
    - Analyze the source database structure to determine the data that needs to be extracted and transformed.
    - Identify any data quality issues that need to be addressed before moving the data to the data warehouse.
3. **Extract Data from the Source Database**
    - Use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to extract the data from the source database.
    - Transform the data as needed to fit the star schema data warehouse design.
    - Load the transformed data into the appropriate fact tables and dimensions in the data warehouse.
4. **Write Queries**
    - Write SQL queries to retrieve data from the data warehouse.
    - Test the queries to ensure they provide the expected results.
    - Optimize the queries as needed for performance.
5. **Schedule Data Updates**
    - Set up a schedule for updating the data in the data warehouse to ensure it stays current.
